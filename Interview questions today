Qualcomm Interview experience:


-> How would you share the variables between processes?
How you take care of the synchronization that is to happen between the resources?

-> What are the volatile and the static keywords? How do they work?

-> In the following logic , as it is a pre increment operation on x in line 20, the pointer value is updated to 5.
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

int x = 4;
int y = 0;
int *ptr = &x;


y = ++x + *ptr;

printf("y:%d x:%d *ptr:%d", y,x,*ptr);

}

->#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

int x = 4;
int y = 0;
int *ptr = &x;

if(x-=y) > 0)
{

    y = 1;
}

printf("y:%d x:%d", y, x);

y = *ptr + x++;

printf("y:%d x:%d *ptr:%d", y,x,*ptr);

}


-> Behaviour of variables across function calls. C program

-> Write a program for getting the count of leading zeroes in a given integer?

-> How will you dereference a void* pointer? What is default pointer type?
